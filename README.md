# File-Verification-using-Hashing-
Finding the checksum of input file using SHA1 and comparing checksums of two files.
sha1.h and sha1.cpp files have been downloaded for internet as SHA1 library.
client.cpp can be used to run and test code.
Orignal text file is text.txt
text1.txt is same file as orignal text file and hence should give same Hash value.
text2.txt has been modified slightly and gives completely different hash value.
